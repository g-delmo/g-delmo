Hello.

I would fill this up with fancy widgets but I don't want to bore you.

I'm currently working for [Scout](https://github.com/scoutapp-ai) as a front-end developer.

I use TypeScript most of the time, and React, and Next.js.

I love writing vanilla CSS, and using styled-components with my React code.

I also use Express & MongoDB for back-end solutions.

Shoot me an [email](mailto:guillermo.delmolino@gmail.com) if you want to get in touch.
